## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

The dataset `instacart` contains 1384617 observations on 15 variables.
Each row represents a product from an instacart order. The variables
contain information about products such as product id, name, and when
the product was ordered. The variable `reordered` denotes that if the
product has been ordered by the user in the past. The dataset further
includes information about user id and order id. The variables also give
information about the aisle (e.g. yogurt) and department (e.g. dairy
eggs) of the product.

Based on the table below, there are 134 aisles, and the fresh vegetables
aisle is the most items ordered from.

``` r
instacart |> 
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(n_obs))
```

    # A tibble: 134 × 2
       aisle                          n_obs
       <chr>                          <int>
     1 fresh vegetables              150609
     2 fresh fruits                  150473
     3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
     4 yogurt                         55240
     5 packaged cheese                41699
     6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
     7 milk                           32644
     8 chips pretzels                 31269
     9 soy lactosefree                26240
    10 bread                          23635
    # ℹ 124 more rows

The plot below shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, arranged
in an ascending order.

``` r
instacart |> 
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) |> 
  filter(n_obs > 10000) |> 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n_obs)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n_obs)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "count", title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

The table summarizes the three most popular items in the aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`.

``` r
instacart |> 
  filter(
    aisle == "baking ingredients" |
    aisle == "dog food care" | 
    aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") |> 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) |> 
  summarize(n_order = n()) |> 
  mutate(
    n_order_rank = min_rank(desc(n_order))) |> 
  arrange(desc(n_order)) |> 
  filter(n_order_rank <= 3) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

The next table shows the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. The 0-6 in
`order_dow` variable represent the day of the week when the order was
placed. The Pink Lady Apples were generally purchased earlier in the day
compared to the Coffee Ice Cream.

``` r
instacart |> 
  filter(
    product_name == "Pink Lady Apples"|
    product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream") |> 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |> 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = product_name,
    values_from = mean_hour) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

| order_dow | Coffee Ice Cream | Pink Lady Apples |
|----------:|-----------------:|-----------------:|

|         6 |            13.83 |            11.94 |

## Problem 2

Load and clean the dataset.

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")

brfss <-
  brfss_smart2010 |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  rename(state = locationabbr,
         county = locationdesc) |> 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health"& 
           response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))|> 
  mutate(
    response = 
      factor(response, 
             levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")),
    county = substring(county, 6))
```

The above codes load and clean the dataset `brfss_smart2010`. The
cleaned dataset `brfss` contains 10625 observations and 23 variables
focused on the “Overall Health” topic with responses from “Poor” to
“Excellent”.

A total of 6 states, CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, and PA states, were observed at
7 or more locations in 2002. States CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY,
OH, PA, SC, TX, and WA were observed at 7 or more location in 2010.

``` r
brfss |> 
  filter(year == 2002) |> 
  group_by(state) |> 
  summarize(
    n_states = 
      n_distinct(county)) |> 
  filter(n_states >= 7) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

| state | n_states |
|:------|---------:|
| CT    |        7 |
| FL    |        7 |
| MA    |        8 |
| NC    |        7 |
| NJ    |        8 |
| PA    |       10 |

``` r
brfss |> 
  filter(year == 2010) |> 
  group_by(state) |> 
  summarize(
    n_states = 
      n_distinct(county)) |> 
  filter(n_states >= 7) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

| state | n_states |
|:------|---------:|
| CA    |       12 |
| CO    |        7 |
| FL    |       41 |
| MA    |        9 |
| MD    |       12 |
| NC    |       12 |
| NE    |       10 |
| NJ    |       19 |
| NY    |        9 |
| OH    |        8 |
| PA    |        7 |
| SC    |        7 |
| TX    |       16 |
| WA    |       10 |

The “spaghetti” plot of the mean crude prevalence for the response
“Excellent” against year. Each line in the plot represents a state
across years. The plot shows that the data value (crude prevalence) is
relatively stable from 2002 to 2010, with no significant increase or
decrease.

``` r
brfss |> 
  filter(response == "Excellent") |> 
  group_by(state, year) |> 
  mutate(
    mean_data_value = mean(data_value)) |> 
  select(year, state, mean_data_value) |> 
  unique() |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_data_value, color = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(y = "crude prevalence (%)", 
       title = "Mean crude prevalence across year for each state") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_sz3213_files/figure-gfm/the spaghetti plot-1.png" width="90%" />

The boxplot represents the `data_value`, which is crude prevalence, for
responses from “Poor” to “Excellent” in NY state in 2006 and 2010. In
both years, the response “Poor” has the lowest crude prevalence, which
means the least people responded “Poor” when evaluating their health
conditions. Most people have chosen responses “Very good” or “Good”. In
2010, there was a larger proportion of “Very good” responses than in
2006.

``` r
brfss |> 
  filter((year == 2006 | year == 2010) & state == "NY") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value, color = response)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(. ~ year) + 
  labs(y = "crude prevalence (%)", title = "Crude prevalence vs. responses in NY State") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 3

Load and clean the datasets.

``` r
accel <- 
  read_csv("data/nhanes_accel.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  pivot_longer(
    min1:min1440,
    names_to = "min",
    values_to = "accel_value",
    names_prefix = "min") |> 
  mutate(
    min = as.numeric(min)
  )

covar <- 
  read_csv("data/nhanes_covar.csv", skip = 4) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(age >= 21) |> 
  mutate(
    sex = case_match(
      sex,
      1 ~ "male",
      2 ~ "female"),
    sex = factor(
      sex, 
      levels = c("male", "female"))) |> 
  drop_na()

nhanes_df <-
  inner_join(covar, accel)
```

The cleaned dataset `nhanes_df` includes 328320 observations and 7
variables. It holds MIMS values measured in minutes in a 24-hour course.
The variables also store information such as sequence number, age, sex,
BMI, and education level.

The table below contains the number of men and women in each education
category (1, 2, and 3). For both females and males, most subjects have
more than a high school education. Among the female participants, the
smallest proportion held qualifications equivalent to a high school
education, while among the male participants, the lowest percentage
possessed education below the high school level.

``` r
nhanes_df |> 
  select(seqn, sex, age, education) |> 
  unique() |> 
  group_by(sex, education) |> 
  summarize(count = n()) |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = sex,
    values_from = count) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

| education | male | female |
|----------:|-----:|-------:|
|         1 |   27 |     28 |
|         2 |   35 |     23 |
|         3 |   56 |     59 |

The boxplot illustrates the the age distributions for men and women in
each education category. It is worth noting that both male and female
subjects with education level above high school have the lowest median
age compared to those in other education categories. Within the female
group, those possessing a high school education have the highest median
age, while in the male group, individuals with education levels below
high school have the highest median age. In addition, females with a
high school education tend to be older than their male counterparts with
similar educational backgrounds.

``` r
nhanes_df |> 
  select(seqn, sex, age, education) |> 
  unique() |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = age, color = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Age distributions by education category for men and women") +
  facet_grid(. ~ education)
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_sz3213_files/figure-gfm/boxplot for age distribution-1.png" width="90%" />

The next plot compares the total MIMS value of men and women across
three education levels. The total MIMS value for participants over 60 is
generally lower than that for other participants. Furthermore, for
participants with at least a high school education level, males tend to
have higher MIMS measures than females.

``` r
nhanes_df |> 
  group_by(seqn, sex, age, education) |> 
  summarize(accel_sum = sum(accel_value)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = accel_sum, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(. ~ education) +
  labs(y = "total MIMS value", title = "Total MIMS value vs. age") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_sz3213_files/figure-gfm/total MIMS value vs. age-1.png" width="90%" />

The plot below shows the mean MIMS values in 24-hour activity time
courses for men and women with each education level. The activity was
measured in a minute-base, from 1 to 1440. According to the plot, the
mean MIMS value gradually decreased in the first 300 minutes (5 hours)
and then increased in the next 250 minutes (~4 hours). In the next 6
hours, the MIMS activity of participants in education categories 1 and 2
dropped slowly while that for participants in education category 3 was
relatively stable. Then the MIMS value drops for all groups in the last
5 hours. In addition, the mean MIMS value for females in education
category 3 was slightly higher than their male counterparts.

``` r
nhanes_df |> 
  group_by(min, sex, education) |> 
  mutate(
    mean_accel = mean(accel_value),
    min = as.numeric(min)) |> 
  select(sex, education, min, mean_accel) |> 
  unique() |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = min, y = mean_accel, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(education ~ .) +
  labs(y = "mean MIMS value", title = "Mean MIMS values in 24-hour activity time courses") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
